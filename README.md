# Nexus 
ðŸ¤– Nexus is robot software for use on a simple Pi or other GPIO-based system. It is made possible with the assistance of an LLM (large language model) like LLaMA 3.2.
## Features
- It uses YOLOv8 software to detect objects out of a camera
- It uses OpenPaw software as a proxy
- Requires a local machine (a good control station) that can run large language models efficiently, otherwise it will be super slow
- Completely real-time (*unless your network is slow, minimum Wi-Fi 4 or 5-gigabit Ethernet connection recommended)
